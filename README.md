# HaskellProjectGenerator
Interactive Haskell project template generator

## Usage
Since this program was designed for me, you should customise some files before you use this program. Below are the customisation instructions.

1. Have a look at files of `static` directory, and customise them if required.
2. Modify `app/Template.hs` if necessary.
3. Edit `app/Input.hs`.
4. `stack install` or `cabal install`
