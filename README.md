## Usage
Since this program was designed for me, you should customise some files before you use this program. Below are the customisation instructions.

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Have a look at files of `static` directory, and customise them if required.
3. Modify `app/Template.hs` if necessary.
4. Edit `app/Input.hs`.
5. `stack install` or `cabal install`
